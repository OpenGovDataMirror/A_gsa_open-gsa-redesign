## Overview

Search.gov is a service of the General Services Administration, providing search engine capability to federal agencies for their public websites. To learn more about Search.gov and how to set up your site for search, please review the [site launch guide](https://search.gov/manual/site-launch-guide.html).

This API exposes all relevant Search.gov results “modules” in a single JSON call, including the following:

  * Web results
  * Best bets
  * Health topics
  * Job openings
  * Recent tweets
  * Recent news
  * Recent video news
  * Federal Register documents
  * Related searches

## Getting Started

The endpoint is `https://api.gsa.gov/technology/searchgov/v2/results/i14y`.

## Note about Web Results and Endpoints

The endpoint you use to retrieve web results through this API will depend on the method we used to index your content. If we don't yet have your content indexed, you won't see results in the API.
  
We can index content using your [XML sitemap](https://search.gov/blog/sitemaps.html) (preferred) or [RSS feeds](https://search.gov/manual/rss.html). We can also deploy a crawler on a limited basis.
  
Sites indexed via sitemaps or crawling will use the `/i14y` endpoint. Because most users are in this category, the example API calls below are to this endpoint. Sites indexed via RSS will use the top level `/` endpoint, please modify your calls accordingly.

## API Description

## Parameters
  
  Three parameters are required: (1) `affiliate`, (2) `access_key`, and (3) `query`. All others are optional.

  * You can find your site handle on the Search.gov Admin Center Settings page.
  * Your access key is unique to your site handle so they must be paired properly to return results. If you have more than one search site set up, make sure you've selected the right one to get the right handle/key combination.
  * Replace `SEARCH_TERM_ENTERED_IN_YOUR_SEARCH_BOX` with the query entered by the searchers using your website's search box.
  * Preformatted request strings with your unique values are provided in the [Search.gov Admin Center](https://search.usa.gov/sites/) > Your Site > Activate > Search Results API Instructions. 

  | Parameters                      | Description
  | :--								| :--
  | affiliate (required)			| Site handle <br> Example: `affiliate=YOUR_SITE_HANDLE`
  |	access\_key (required)			| The key used to access the API <br> Example: `access_key=YOUR_UNIQUE_ACCESS_KEY_FROM_ADMIN_CENTER`
  | query (required)			    | Search term <br> Example: `query=SEARCH_TERM_ENTERED_IN_YOUR_SEARCH_BOX`
  | enable\_highlighting (optional) | Enables or disables the highlighting of keywords in the results. The default is 'true' so use 'false' to disable highlighting. The opening and closing highlighting characters are `<U+E000>` and `<U+E001>`, which both look like "". You can learn more about them [here](http://unicodesymbols.wikia.com/wiki/U%2BE000) and [here](http://unicodesymbols.wikia.com/wiki/U%2BE001) (external resources). Your team will determine how to display the characters, whether as bold, italics, or some other preferred highlighting style. <br> Example: `enable_highlighting=false`
  | limit (optional)                | Defines the number of results to return. The default is 20, but you can specify between 1 and 50 results. <br> Example: `limit=5`
  | offset (optional)               | Defines the number of results you want to skip from the first result. The offset is used for implementing pagination. The default is 0 and the maximum is 999. <br> Example: `offset=20`
  | sort\_by (optional)             | Allowed variables are date and relevance. The default sort is relevance. Add `sort_by=date` to sort by date.

## Expected Results

  Each item returns a unique set of fields. Each array will only have contents if there are results in that search feature matching the query.
  
  Before you begin: If you set up the Routed Query feature in the Search.gov Admin Center, you will need to set up some additional logic. If there's a match between the query and the Routed Query, we'll return only the `route_to` URL. Otherwise we'll return the full results set. See <a href="#rq">Routed Queries</a>.

  * ### query
  
      We return the query to you for use in the results page display.

  * ### web:total

## Routed Queries

If you have [Routed Queries](https://search.gov/manual/routed-queries.html) set up in your Admin Center, then any matching query terms will change the API response.

For instance, if you set the query `example` to route to `https://www.search.gov`, then the expected response will be the following:

`{"route_to":"https://www.search.gov/"}`

To fully implement this, you will have to add logic that will process this response and redirect the user. A site-specific API call and javascript sample are available within the [Search.gov Admin Center](https://search.usa.gov/sites/) > Your Site > Activate > Search Results API Instructions.
